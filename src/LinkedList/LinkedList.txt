Singly linked list
- a data structure used for collection of nodes that have the following properties:
    * contain sequence of nodes
    * node has a data and reference to the next node in a list
    * first node is the head node
    * last node had data and points to null

Implementation of a singly linkedList
    // Generic type
    public class ListNode<T>{
        private T data;
        private ListNode<T> next;
    }

    // Integer type
    public class ListNode{
        private int data;
        private ListNode next;
    }

LinkedList don't have continuous memory allocation as in arrays
Head - the first node
Insertion in singly linkedList - O(n)
