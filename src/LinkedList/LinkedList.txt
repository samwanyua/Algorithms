LinkedList
- data structure that stores collection of data
- contain sequential nodes
- first node is the head
- last node is the tail

Creating a single linkedList
// head is an instance variable
head = new ListNode(10); // data is 10, currently head points to null
ListNode second = new ListNode(1); // next is pointing to null, data is 1
ListNode third = new ListNode(8);
ListNode fourth = new ListNode(11);
head.next = second;
second.next = third;
third.next = fourth;
