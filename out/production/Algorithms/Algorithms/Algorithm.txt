Algorithms
* Linear search
- iterates through a collection one element at a time
- runtime of O(1)
- slow for large data sets
- faster searches of small data sets
- does not need to be sorted
- useful for data structures that do not have random access (linked list)

* Binary search
- search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
- half of the array is eliminated during each step
- the elements needs to be sorted
- runtime O(log n)
- efficient with large data sets
